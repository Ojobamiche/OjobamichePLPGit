Creating a New Text File and Adding a Simple Text Message in Git

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your local folder where you want to create the file.

3. Run the following command to create the file and add the text message:

   ```bash
   echo "Hello, Git!" > hello.txt
This command creates a new file named hello.txt and writes "Hello, Git!" into it.

Verify that the file has been created and contains the expected text message by running:
bash
Copy code
cat hello.txt
This command displays the contents of the hello.txt file.
If you want to add this file to a Git repository, initialize a new Git repository in your current directory by running:
bash
Copy code
git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
Add the newly created file to the staging area using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git add hello.txt
This command stages the changes in the hello.txt file for the next commit.
Commit the changes to the Git repository by running:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a simple message"
This command commits the staged changes with a commit message.
